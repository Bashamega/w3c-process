This in an FAQ for the [W3C Process document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Drafts/), with the intended audience being W3C Working Group members — and their chairs — who are trying to understand various aspects of the W3C process.

## Technical Reports

### What is a Technical Report?

Anywhere you see or hear the term _“Technical Report”_, you can substitute the term _“W3C Publication”_. So, for example, you can read the beginning of the section at https://www.w3.org/policies/process/drafts/#Reports as:

> #### W3C Publications
>
> The W3C Publication development process is the set of steps and requirements followed by W3C Working Groups to standardize Web technology. The W3C Publication development process is designed to…

And you can read the heading the section at https://www.w3.org/policies/process/drafts/#recs-and-notes as:

> #### Types of W3C Publications

### What is a TR?

_“TR”_ is an abbreviation for _“Technical Report”_. In other words, you any time you see or hear _“TR”_, you can substitute the term _“W3C Publication”_.

### What is TR space?

_“TR space”_ means https://www.w3.org/TR/ — that is, it’s the area of the w3.org website under which W3C standards are published. So any time you see or hear the term _“TR space”_, you can substitute the term _“W3C publications space”_ — or even _“W3C standards space”_.

## Living standards

This section contains information about publication of so-called “living standards” or “evergreen standards” at the W3C.

### Does the W3C have living standards?

Yes. For any of your working-group deliverables which have reached CR, your group has the option to keep that deliverable at CR as a so-called “living standard” or “evergreen standard” — which you can, from then on, continuously update at any time; that is, without any intent to ever advance the document to Recommendation.

In other words, that continuously-updated CR becomes the terminal state of that deliverable in the W3C publication-maturity process for web standards (which, in the Process document itself, is what’s described in the section titled [The W3C Recommendation Track](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Drafts/#rec-track)).
