This in an FAQ for the [W3C Process document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Drafts/), with the intended audience being W3C Working Group members — and their chairs — who are trying to understand various aspects of the W3C process.

## Living standards

This section contains information about publication of so-called “living standards” or “evergreen standards” at the W3C.

### Does the W3C have living standards?

Yes. For any of your working-group deliverables which have reached CR, your group has the option to keep that deliverable at CR as a so-called “living standard” or “evergreen standard” — which you can, from then on, continuously update at any time; that is, without any intent to ever advance the document to Recommendation.

In other words, that continuously-updated CR becomes the terminal state of that deliverable in the W3C publication-maturity process for web standards (which, in the Process document itself, is what’s described in the section titled [The W3C Recommendation Track](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Drafts/#rec-track)).
