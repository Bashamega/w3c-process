This in an explainer for the [W3C Process document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Drafts/), with the intended audience being W3C Working Group members — and their chairs — who are trying to understand various aspects of the W3C process. This explainer is incomplete and, so far, contains only information related to publication of “living standards”.

## The W3C Recommendation Track

This section of the explainer so far contains only one subsection, on publication of so-called “living standards”.

### Living standards

For any of your deliverables which have reached CR, your group has the option to keep that deliverable at CR as a so-called “living standard” or “evergreen standard” — which you can, from then on, continuously update at any time; that is, without any intent to ever advance the document to Recommendation.

In other words, that continuously-updated CR becomes the terminal state of that deliverable in the W3C publication-maturity process for web standards (which, in the Process document itself, is what’s described in the section titled [The W3C Recommendation Track](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Drafts/#rec-track)).
